        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350Â°F.</li>
            <br>
            <li>In a large bowl with either a hand-held mixer or stand mixer, beat the cream cheese until soft, 1-2 minutes.</li>
            <br>
            <li>On medium-high speed, slowly mix in the egg yolks.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Continuing to mix on medium-high speed, add in the sweetened condensed milk, followed by the lime juice.</li>
            <br>
            <li>If using food coloring, transfer the batter into smaller bowls:<br>
                <br>
                For green: Add in 1-2 drops of green food coloring, until desired color is achieved.<br>
                <br>
                For orange: Add in 2 drops of red food coloring, followed by 12 drops of yellow food coloring until the desired color is achieved.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Evenly divide the batter between the graham cracker crusts.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Place the crusts on an oven-safe pan and transfer to the oven, baking for 14-15 minutes until the middle of the batters only slightly jiggle in the middle.</li>  
            <br>
            <li>Remove from the oven and let the pies cool at room temperature before transferring to the refrigerator for a minimum of two hours.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Remove pies from the refrigerator and serve with whipped cream, or decorate accordingly. Baked pies can be stored in the refrigerator for up to one week!</li>
