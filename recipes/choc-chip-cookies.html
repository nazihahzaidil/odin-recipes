        <h1>Chocolate Chip Cookies Recipe</h1>
        <h2>The best chocolate chip cookies you will ever bake!</h2>
        <p>"My go-to recipe," says Andrea Howard. "I sometimes add oatmeal, nuts, raisins, etc. but they are also fantastic without. Crunchy and chewy in every bite!"
            <br>
            "This is hands down the best chocolate chip cookie recipe!" raves Baybos the baker man. "So good that we want to quadruple the recipe and freeze a few batches."
            <br>
            "I decided to give this recipe a try," says another reviewer. "I have been making chocolate chip cookies for my family for years and this recipe turned out to be the best for cookies ever! I usually add about 2 and a half cups of chocolate chips because it gives it that gooey, chocolatey taste that I think chocolate chip cookies need."</p>
